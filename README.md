# Plex-qBit-Sonarr-Radarr-Prowlarr-Pihole-Flaresolverr
docker-compose with these services installed. You just need to setup each services. Any suggestions much appreciated !


# What can I do with this ?

Apart of pihole, each of these services is a part for a completely automated media center. 

In theory, when all is set up, you just have to choose your favourite serie and the media center will download, process, rename, sort and make it ready to go !

> You have to modify `docker-compose.yml` with PATH to locate your files.

If you don't need pihole, that's not a problem, you can delete line `89->108`.
