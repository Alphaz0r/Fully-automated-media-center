docker-compose with these services installed. You just need to setup each services. Any suggestions much appreciated !


TODO : Describe each services


# What can I do with this ?

Apart of pihole, each of these services is a part for a completely automated media center. 

In theory, you just have to choose your favourite serie and the media center will download, process, rename, sort and make it ready to go !


If you don't need pihole, that's not a problem, you can delete line `89->108`.
