# Plex-qBit-Sonarr-Radarr-Prowlarr-Pihole-Flaresolverr
docker-compose with these services installed. You just need to setup each services. Any suggestions much appreciated !

# What can I do with these ?

Apart of pihole, each of these services is a part for a completely automated media center. 

In theory, you just have to choose your favourite serie and the media center will download, process, rename, sort and make it ready to go !
